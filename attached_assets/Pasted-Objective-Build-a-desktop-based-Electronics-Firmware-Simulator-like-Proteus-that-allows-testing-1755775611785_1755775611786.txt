Objective:
Build a desktop-based Electronics + Firmware Simulator (like Proteus) that allows testing and debugging of smart meter firmware and general embedded projects.

Core MVP Features:

Firmware Loader

Accept .hex and .bin files.

Allow user to specify target microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M, RL78, STM32, ESP32, etc.) and package type.

Load firmware into virtual MCU flash.

Microcontroller & Architecture Support

Basic models: STM32F4, STM32G0, Renesas RL78, ESP32.

Support for register-level emulation (basic peripherals: GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, ADC).

Configurable clock, memory size.

Electronics Components Library (drag & drop)

Resistors, capacitors, diodes, op-amps, switches, LEDs, relays.

Power sources (DC, AC generator, signal generator).

Communication modules (GSM, BLE, WiFi â€” basic dummy response simulation).

Test Inputs for Smart Metering

Single-phase & 3-phase inputs with configurable voltage, current, frequency.

Simulated ADC readings mapped to firmware.

Magnetic tamper input simulation.

Measurement & Debugging Tools

Virtual CRO (oscilloscope).

Multimeter.

Logic analyzer.

UART console/terminal for debugging firmware logs.

User Experience (UI/UX)

Drag-and-drop circuit builder like Proteus.

Component property panel (change resistance, voltage, etc.).

Firmware debug panel (step, run, reset, breakpoints if possible).

Configurable Architecture

Add/remove components dynamically.

Change microcontroller and reload firmware.

Save/load project configurations.

Tech Stack Suggestions (MVP Feasible)

Frontend/UI: Electron.js or Qt (desktop app, drag & drop).

Backend/Simulation Core: C++/Rust for speed, use QEMU or Unicorn Engine for MCU instruction set emulation.

Circuit Simulation: ngspice or custom lightweight SPICE engine integration.

Firmware Debugging: GDB integration for step/debug.

Future Extensions (beyond MVP):

Add IoT modules (LoRa, NB-IoT).

Real-time waveform export.

Scripting API for automated testing.

Integration with Git for firmware CI/CD.
